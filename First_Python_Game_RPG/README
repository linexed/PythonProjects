This RPG Game runs in with python 3. It a fun game, and a cool way to bridge learning python with game development. 
I just wanted to create something as I was learning python. This was my first project with python. 
UPDATE:
This game was created at the end of 2018 as a learning project for python. I moved the files into a subfolder to keep my GitHub clean.
